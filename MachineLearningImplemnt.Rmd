```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Choose variables

The examin of the sensor data pattern shows that the variables covered are all more or less non-trivially correlated to the excercisers' movement quality. Therefore it is plausible to include all of them in the machine learning algorithm as a first attempt of prediction. 

```{r variables}
varPredictor = c("gyros_arm_x", "gyros_arm_y", "gyros_arm_z","accel_arm_x", "accel_arm_y", "accel_arm_z","magnet_arm_x", "magnet_arm_y", "magnet_arm_z")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
